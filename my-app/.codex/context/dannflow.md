# DannFlow Notes for Codex

DannFlow is a Next.js 15+, React 19, Supabase, Tailwind v4, Shadcn/UI starter
optimized for AI-assisted development.

## Operating Order

1. Read `AGENTS.md` before taking action.
2. Read `CLAUDE.md` for richer project context.
3. For feature work, check `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` if present.
4. For new features, check `src/prompts/features/` before scaffolding.
5. Keep business logic and Supabase queries in `src/services/`.
6. Use generated types from `src/types/supabase.ts`; never use `any`.

## Database Discipline

Assume RLS is active on every table. Service queries must include explicit user,
tenant, or ownership filters unless the endpoint is intentionally public.

Before schema-sensitive work:

```bash
pnpm checkpoint
pnpm db:generate
pnpm db:migrate
```

Author schema changes in `db/schema/*.ts`, generate SQL into `db/migrations/`,
review that SQL, then apply it with `pnpm db:migrate`. Use Supabase MCP for live
schema reads, advisors, verification, project provisioning, and checkpoints. Do
not use MCP `apply_migration` for normal tracked schema changes.

## UI Discipline

Use Tailwind and Shadcn semantic tokens only:

- Backgrounds: `bg-background`, `bg-card`, `bg-muted`
- Text: `text-foreground`, `text-muted-foreground`, `text-primary`
- Borders: `border`, `border-border`, `border-input`
- Brand: `bg-primary`, `text-primary-foreground`

Avoid raw `button` elements for app UI. Use Shadcn `Button`.

## Codex Command Bridge

The `.claude/commands/` files remain the command source of truth. Codex should
load those prompts through `.codex/commands/claude-command.md` instead of copying
or rewriting them.
